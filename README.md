Completed the first task of my virtual internship with Bharat Intern : Iris Classification.
This ML model consists of a thorough analysis of the Iris flower Species and a prediction model that predicts the species name based on a given set of inputs.
Here, I have used my skills of Data preprocessing and cleaning, Data Visualisaion and Analytics along with Machine learning algorithms; making use of Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn etc.
Completed the second task of my virtual internship with Bharat Intern : House price prediction.
This ML model consists of intensive data preprocessing and cleaning which is then visualised to dig out useful insights.
Based on several factors such as distance from metro station, size in sqft, locality etc. the rental prices for flats across Delhi are predicted.
Here, I have used my skills of data mining, cleaning and manipulation along with data visualisation and analytics.Also, I have used various Machine learning algorithms to develop a successful Prediction model for predicting rentalprices for houses across Delhi.
