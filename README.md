Completed the first task of my virtual internship with Bharat Intern : Iris Classification.
This ML model consists of a thorough analysis of the Iris flower Species and a prediction model that predicts the species name based on a given set of inputs.
Here, I have used my skills of Data preprocessing and cleaning, Data Visualisaion and Analytics along with Machine learning algorithms; making use of Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn etc.
